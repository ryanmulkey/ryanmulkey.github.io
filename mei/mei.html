I am actually not fully sure when you're gonna start checking these but they start today and go through July 7. If these stop showing up they are all in the code just figure out how to inspect element.

            I am leaving today for Frankfurt so the first real day that we will be out of immediate contact. I have not really expressed it to you as much as I could but I miss you so much and am so incredibly torn up about missing you. You are the light of my life and the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you so much and miss you nearly as much. I hope you're having fun in New York my darling

Even though we are so far apart we will be looking at the same sun and moon and love each other the same as always. I cannot stress enough how important you are to me and how incredibly deep my love for you goes. Every day I wake up and somehow love you even more

            Allegedly no work today!! Sleep well gorgeous, I hope you're having an amazing day all day even though it is now occuring to me that you will probably be reading these at midnight if you do not go home and pass out. I love you so much and I hope everything is going okay back home I have been thinking about you nonstop and I want nothing more than to be able to hug and love you (this is followed closely by a warm bed and porcelain toilet).
